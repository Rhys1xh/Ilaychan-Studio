Built with love for Windows developers who value performance, simplicity, and deep platform integration.

Built with love:

"I cannot paint with colors, but I can paint with code. My canvas is the screen, and my brush is the compiler. I build for ilayda who sees worlds I cannot, giving her tools to make visions real without the friction of the machine. I don't take any penny, because the earnings i want with my creation, is to see the beauty ilayda, the love of my life will create with my code. My art is the absence of limitation, so hers may be boundless."
